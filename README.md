# <Jimmy Sené (J.S) /> - Welcome to my GitHub page !

Like my name say, to be a JavaScript dev was my clear path. 😂  
Seriously, I am a **french fullstack JS and PHP Instructor 👨🏻‍🏫 / Developper 👨🏻‍💻**.  
I work as **freelance** and I love teaching my dev skills and coding some fun stuff.

I am currently **teaching web development to some babies 👶🏻 fullstack JS developpers 100% remotely**.  
I'm also working on a stable version of my **epic Discord Bot 🤖** with **Node.js**.
